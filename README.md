# 2024-2025-Lakers-Data-Analysis
#### This excel project shows an analysis on the Los Angeles Laker (NBA team) on 2024-2025 season. This includes the statistics of players, including Luka Doncic, Lebron James, and Austin Reaves as well as their production before and after Luka was traded and arrived on the Lakers.
#### This project was made because of ongoing discussions that Lebron, Luka, and Reaves won't work as they will just bring themselves down and will eat each other's production. I made an analysis to know if it is true or not.
##### Skill Used: Data Cleaning, Formulas, Pivot Table, Pivot Chart, Power Query, Data Validation, Vlookup

This sheet shows the Title and content of the whole file. This includes;
1. Luka Stats when he was in Dallas and when he is playing on the Lakers
2. Lebron and Reaves productivity before Luka and when he arrived and;
3. Player Statistics (with chart analysis and dropdown list for Laker player averages)

## Luka Doncic 2025 Statistics (Dallas vs. Lakers)

To do this analysis, I used Averageif formula to show Luka's averages when he was in Dallas and when he was on the Lakers. 
There is no significant difference on production when he was playing on Dallas and when he was traded on the Lakers. 

## Lebron and Reaves Stats before Luka and during Luka

To do this analysis, I also used Averageif formula to know Lebron and Reaves averages pre-Luka and during Luka.
Again, the analysis shows a little difference on production, even an increase to Lebron and Reaves when they played with Luka.

This sheet shows the Laker Player's statistics which includes Points Per Game, Rebounds Per Game, Assist Per game, Field Goal Percentage, 3 point Percentage, and Awards that year (2025)
The sheet also shows a bar chart that tells who has the highest productivity among Laker player in both Offense and defense which shows the Points Per Game and STOCKS which is the combined average of Steals and Blocks.
To do this analysis, I used Vlookup to get the Average Stats of Players, Data Validation to get the dropdown list of all of the Laker Player which can be use to show the Stats of all the players. I also used Pivottable and Pivot chart to get the productivity in terms of offense (PPG), and in terms of defense (STOCKS/Steals + Blocks) of Players.
