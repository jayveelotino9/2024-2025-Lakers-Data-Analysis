# 2024-2025-Lakers-Data-Analysis
#### This excel project shows an analysis on the Los Angeles Laker (NBA team) on 2024-2025 season. This includes the statistics of players, including Luka Doncic, Lebron James, and Austin Reaves as well as their production before and after Luka was traded and arrived on the Lakers.
#### This project was made because of ongoing discussions that Lebron, Luka, and Reaves won't work as they will just bring themselves down and will eat each other's production. I made an analysis to know if it is true or not.

This sheet shows the Title and content of the whole file. This includes;
1. Luka Stats when he was in Dallas and when he is playing on the Lakers
2. Lebron and Reaves productivity before Luka and when he arrived and;
3. Player Statistics (with chart analysis and dropdown list for Laker player averages)

## Luka Doncic 2025 Statistics (Dallas vs. Lakers)

To do this analysis, I used Averageif formula to show Luka's averages when he was in Dallas and when he was on the Lakers. 
There is no significant difference on production when he was playing on Dallas and when he was traded on the Lakers. 

## Lebron and Reaves Stats before Luka and during Luka

To do this analysis, I also used Averageif formula to know Lebron and Reaves averages pre-Luka and during Luka.
Again, the analysis shows a little difference on production, even an increase to Lebron and Reaves when they played with Luka.
